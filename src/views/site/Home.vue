    She had locked something away, something deep inside.  A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.  And she couldn't break free.  So I decided to search for it.  I went deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.  And I broke in..

    Sin Eaters is a role playing game about people who delve into the boundless figments and hauntings of the mind.  The theme is inspired by, and a love letter to, works such as <i>Psychonauts</i>, <i>The Cell (2002)</i>, <i>To The Moon</i>, and <i>Inception</i>.  Within, we follow a crew of characters willing to sacrifice themselves to journey into the mental universe of the traumatized and the dying, and save them from themselves.

    What is a Sin Eater?
</h2>

<blockquote>
    I give easement and rest now to thee. Come not down the lanes or in our meadows. And for thy peace, I pawn my own soul. Amen.

<p>
    The dying are consumed by their sins at the edge of their life.  Death for the sinful damns their soul to the earth, to plague the living as wraiths and ghosts forever more.  Penance cannot help them.  Their body is failing, they cannot perform the rites.  Their loved ones must make a choice: let them die in the horror of their own failings, or call out for you: a sin eater.
</p>

<p>
    Sin eating was a real practice in the UK and other parts of the world between 1600 and 1900.  On the verge of death a sin eater might get called, their job to undertake a ritual meal whereby the sins of the dying were passed onto the food, and then into the eater.  And for their service, what did they get?  A little money, and enormous shame.  You see, a sin eater bears all the sins of those whome they've served.  A person with that much sin has no good place in society.

<p>
    This game is not historically accurate.  Far from it.  We're here to magify the transaction of the sin eaters in fantasy and imagination.  What if, to those people, the ritual were more than a meal?  What if it were a transcendant and harrowing adventure.  A gamble of their own humanity against the sin they consumed, an effort to internalize the abysses of another person's life?
