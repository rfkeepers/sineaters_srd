Death will damn their soul to the earth, to plague the living as wraiths and ghosts forever more. Penance cannot help them. Their body is quickly failing, they can no longer perform the rites. The family and friends close by must make a choice: let them die an unclean, damned death; or call out for you, a sin eater. </p><p> Sin eating was a real practice in the UK and other parts of the world throughout the 1600s to the 1900s. Sin eaters were called to help those on the verge of death, their job to undertake a ritual meal where the sins of the dying were passed onto the food, and then into the eater. </p><p> And what did they get for their service? A little money along with enormous shame. You see, a sin eater bore all the sins of those whom they&#39;ve served. They were living anathema, walking hell. The person who carries such tarnish has no good place in society. </p><p> This game is not historically accurate. Far from it. We&#39;re here to magify the transaction of the sin eaters in fantasy and imagination. What if, to those people, the ritual were more than a meal? What if it were a transcendant and harrowing adventure. A gamble of their own humanity against the sin they consumed, an effort to internalize the abysses of another person&#39;s life?

Meanwhile immigration peaks in urban and coastal places. Ethnic traditions mingle and thrive. The mixing pots of the new era churn within cities while rural life stays dark and distant. Feminism swells as women look to political legitimacy through the suffrage movement. </p><p> Streets scintillate with electric lamps, although fewer than three percent of houses have the same power. Automobiles are about to roar to dominance. The Model-T nears its appearance in eight years, and across the following decade cars truly take hold in transportation. Typewriters evolve to their modern shape and women take the field as the new stenographer. Horses still power the farm, in conjunction with mechanical reapers and threshers, while the tractor trundles slowly into frame. </p><p> Entertainment is alive and human. Circuses travel town to town. The wealthy elite enjoy opera and symphony in theaters while the poor frequent dance halls and bars. Journalism and sensationalism battle for control of the presses while readers gorge on wild pulp fantasies. Film ensorcels the public. Kinetoscope parlors and nickelodeons introduce radical new ideas of reality, blurring the lines between live experience and imaginary figments. </p><h3> America Seethes </h3><p> Nativism rears up in retaliation against immigration. Americans eye foreigners in the streets like wolves, fangs out and growling. Antisemitism grows through yellow journalism. Jews are accused of seeking to undermine the working man. Segregation entrenches itself along streets and corridors. </p><p> Anti-African American sentiment thrives among white citizens. Race riots erupt in New Orleans and New York; Atlanta, Springfield, and Slocum will follow soon. Southern trees bear a strange fruit, blood on the leaves and blood at the root. Lynching and torture are community acts. Bodies hang near train lines so that passengers may bear witness. </p><p> Crime overtakes where feckless protectors and judiciaries are unable, or unwilling, to keep pace with the violence. Homicide rates double or triple in the largest cities. The severity of punishment unevenly favors white nationals, if it happens at all. Only about 20 percent of criminals see prosecution. And as the temperance movement gains favor, organized crime is set to take the advantage. </p><h3> America Quarrels for the Mind </h3><p> Spirituality and superstition thrive among the masses while psychologists hustle to legitimize their new science. Widespread curiosity and private donations alike press researchers to investigate the paranormal: telepathy, communication with the dead, hypnosis. Scientists walk a sharp line between professional legitimacy and public interest. </p><p> Invention and technology arouse imagination. Narratives dance around new devices: cameras that capture the soul, trains that crash through movie screens into the crowd. Physicists continue to unveil ray and radiation, proof of a universe full of invisible energies not yet captured. Medicine tampers with substances: radium for a healthy glow, opium for coughs, morphine to sleep through the night, arsenic to fight the infection. </p><p> Little is truly known about neurosis or mental illness. Mary Baker Eddy\u2019s church of Christian Science, a fomenting religious movement of mind-cures, professes the mind as reality and the mortal body as a distorted projection. Healers of the church eschew conventional medicine to focus on metaphysical correction of the spirit. Horatio Dresser&#39;s movement of New Thought declares the internal human spirit as divine and portrays bodily sickness as a corruption in the mind. Meanwhile, asylums are overrun. Standard medical treatment for the patients involve lithium, lobotomy, and electro-convulsive therapy. </p><h2> In The Game </h2><blockquote> The trouble is in the mind, for the body is only the house for the mind to dwell in [...] Therefore, if your mind had been deceived by some invisible enemy into a belief, you have put it into the form of a disease, with or without your knowledge. By my theory or truth, I come in contact with your enemy, and restore you to health and happiness. This I do partly mentally, and partly by talking till I correct the wrong impression and establish the Truth, and the Truth is the cure. <figcaption>Phineas Quimby</figcaption></blockquote><p> America in 1900 is where the game occurs. America at a new era, the crux of superstition and science, revolution and retaliation. The details described above are not, necessarily, what the game is about. But they are how we set the stage for our sin eaters. A country with its fill of problems and solutions alike. Where paranormal belief is healthy and thriving, not suppressed by the modern era, but invigorated. Where the cities sit bright and electric next to isolated and organic countryside. A place where you might seek to save people from themselves in the most supernatural fashion. </p>',18),_s=[fs],gs={setup(t){return(o,s)=>(r(),l("div",null,_s))}};const bs={class:"search"},vs={class:"entries"},ws=["onClick"],ks={class:"entry__type"},$s={setup(t){const o=U(),s=F(),i=C(null),a=()=>{i.value.focus()},d=()=>{var f;(f=i.value)==null||f.blur()};C("");const c=[];vt.forEach(f=>{const m=Object.assign({},f);m.searchable=[m.name,m.type,...m.tags].map(A=>A.toLowerCase()),c.push(m)}),c.sort((f,m)=>f.name.localeCompare(m.name));const g=C(Object.assign({},c)),v=f=>{let m=f.target.value?f.target.value.toLowerCase().trim():"";if(!m){g.value=Object.assign({},c);return}g.value=c.filter(A=>A.searchable.some(x=>x.includes(m)))},_=f=>{var m;s.push({path:`/glossary${f.path}`}),(m=i.value)==null||m.blur(),R("toggleSidebar")};X(()=>{P("sidebarOpen",a),P("sidebarClose",d)}),J(()=>{N("sidebarOpen",a),N("sidebarClose",d)});const y=()=>{if(matchMedia("screen and (max-width: 900px)").matches)return!0;o.path.includes("landing")&&i.value.focus()};return(f,m)=>{const A=L("router-view");return r(),j(he,{initHidden:y},{sidebar:p(()=>[e("div",bs,[e("input",{type:"text",ref_key:"searchInput",ref:i,class:"search__input",placeholder:"search for moves/playbooks/etc",onInput:v},null,544)]),e("div",vs,[e("ul",null,[(r(!0),l(W,null,K(g.value,x=>(r(),l("li",{key:x,class:S({entry:!0,"entry--selected":f.$route.path.includes(x.path)}),onClick:D(u=>_(x),["stop"])},[e("div",null,I(x.name),1),e("div",ks,I(x.type),1)],10,ws))),128))])])]),page:p(()=>[h(A)]),_:1})}}};var Ts=$($s,[["__scopeId","data-v-5ee5b218"]]);const xs={},Is=t=>(O("data-v-6d395690"),t=t(),Y(),t),Ss={class:"glossaryHome"},As=n(" Welcome to the glossary.
