Sin eaters were called to help those on the verge of death, their job to undertake a ritual meal where the sins of the dying were passed onto the food, and then into the eater. </p><p> And what did they get for their service?

As a result, when handling harm, it would be disingenous of the game to track those effects. </p><p> Instead, harm is how we deal with a character&#39;s reaction to an experience that shakes them. It focuses on how the character reponds to the event, more than the event itself. Many ordeals can shake a person: pain, danger, powerlessness, and so on. In the game, all these potential causes funnel down to three frames: Identity, Comprehension, and Horror. </p><h2> Identity Harm </h2><p> People suffer identity harm when their perception or understanding of themselves, or the people or things around them, gets called into question. </p><h2> Comprehension Harm </h2><p> People suffer comprehension harm when they experience the inexplicable, the eldritch, or something which breaks from fundamental understanding. </p><h2> Horror Harm </h2><p> People suffer horror harm when they endure a traumatic, disturbing, or frightening ordeal. </p><h3> When Harmed </h3><p> The person who was harmed must choose one of the following outcomes: </p><p> NPCs... </p>',13),Ft=e("p",null," PCs...
